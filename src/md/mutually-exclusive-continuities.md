<br><center>**Mutually exclusive continuities**</center><br> 

The piece is about interplay. It's about the band, playing together,
cooperating, listening to each other and cueing each other. I love that kind of
stuff. Being in a band is just about the most amazing thing I've ever
experienced. It felt to me like I was a part of something larger. I could lose
myself in that feeling. I became part of this huge sound, together with my
friends. Playing in bands when I was growing up really shaped the way I think
about music and I'll never forget it.

The title for the piece comes from a wikipedia rabbit hole. It looks at how
time travel is portrayed in popular culture and about how it has all these
kinds of wild inconsistencies which amount to tropes at first and then to how
we end up identifying the genre itself. The style of playing that is this piece
could be imagined as an expression of an alternate timeline, where ebows and
ringmodulation holds the equivalent role that plectrums and distortion holds in
our timeline.
