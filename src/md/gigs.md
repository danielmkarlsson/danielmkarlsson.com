<br><center>**Gigs**</center>
These kinds of pages are always a bit weird aren't they? I mean, who are they
for? It's a pretty low key way to get the word out ahead of time, so my thinking
is it'll mostly, if ever, be read after the fact. So I thought that instead of
doing the usual image crafting I would let you know how I got the gigs, and
what they were like. Who was nice to me, and who is the person you should
contact to ask for a gig? Was it a good PA at the venue? Was the tech staff into
the music? How big was the space? Was the audience engaged and listening
attentively? That kind of thing is always what I'm asking folks when they say
they played somewhere.

<center>**Towards a Music for Large Ensemble at Edition VII GRM**</center>

John Chantler booked me for that gig. This was a commisioned piece, also John's
doing. This was an incredible once in a life time kind of experience for me.

<br>

<center>**Towards a music for ensemble at Fylkingen**</center>

Malte Dahlberg booked me for that gig. This was the last gig I did at Fylkingen
when it was located at Torkel Knutssonsgatan 2. It was a pretty chill night. 
Everyone kind of just made it happen, together. I did sound for my friend Hara 
Alonso who played a great set. I performed my piece in four channels. A couple 
of days later I put together this Stereo mix of it.

Linnéa Talp booked me for that gig. This little funeral chapel a little bit
outside of town has an organ in it that I was allowed access to a couple of
times leading up to that show. I did a bunch of recordings of the organ and I
made this piece. I think it is a nice sounding room. It doesn't have a PA so I
borrowed some speakers from EMS. It worked out alright I think. People seemed
to have enjoyed the music.

Mats Lindström booked me for that gig.

<br>

<center>**Past the inflection point at Sound of Stockholm**</center>

Theodor Kentros booked me for that gig.

<br>

<center>**Shipwrecks at Skaiv**</center>

David Åhlen booked me for that gig.

<center>**Ruins in the distance at Fylkingen**</center>

Fylkingen is member run. I am a member. I wanted to give Francesco Torelli the
opportunity to do a gig while he was here, so the two of us put together a
two set evening. I had a good time hanging out with Francesco and also some
friends came out to support us. I've never done that kind of tit for tat thing
of booking a gig for someone from out of town at Fylkingen. This is not that. I
just really dig Francesco and I thought that he should get to experience doing a
gig at Fylkingen while he was here. I guess the way to get a gig at Fylkingen is
either become a member, or to get chummy with a member. Fylkingen has a good PA,
quad Lacoustics with decent subs under each top + extra JBL subs and a good
projector. The thing they didn't have was a cable that was long enough to get
from the projector to the other end of the room. I thought that for sure
Fylkingen would still have that really old, really long VGA cable but it must
have broke since I used it last. 

<!-- I ended up using OS X's built in Screen Sharing. It was not ideal, but I had to think on my feet there, so that's what happened. Luckily the new wifi setup is pretty fast, so there was not all that much latency. I do not recommend doing it that way, but it did work. Would have felt better to ssh or even send the OSC messages over ethernet between the two computers. Maybe next time. The code is very raw. They are single line things that either set a specific value or generate them stochastically between thresholds or choose a value from a list of values. One neat little trick [David Granström](https://davidgranstrom.com/) taught me is subtracting `1` from an `exprand` to invert the range. I like to be able to do that because I remember swapping the values in Haskell and getting that behaviour. I think it's neat. The lines are grouped in parentheses for optics and also there is the top level parentheses which let's me evaluate all lines wherever I'm at with `C + e`. On top of that David taught me this neat trick where you can make a visual selection in [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) and then recall it with less hassle using `gv`. I can make this reselect last selection and then evaluate manouver pretty fast now that my hands are getting into it. You can see me do that a whole bunch in the video below. <video controls="controls" width="100%" name="RuinsAtFylkingen7November2019.mov" src="RuinsAtFylkingen7November2019.mov"></video> -->

<center>**A collapse of structures at Ställbergs Gruva**</center>

Eric Sjögren booked me for this gig. This piece was originally composed for 8
channels and had it’s premiere on the second of August 2019 at Ställbergs Gruva
as part of their three day festival “Att återta det levande”. We encouraged
folks to not have their handComputers with them in the room. This meant that I
don't really have a clip from this gig. I've been thinking I should try to work
something out with the photographer that took stills in the room.

<center>**Intersections of traversals at NorbergFestival**</center>

I was invited by [Sara Fors](http://www.stickydrama.se/om/sara-fors/), [Mattias
Hållsten](https://soundcloud.com/mattiash-llsten) and [Blue
Maignien](http://cherche-encore.info/). Despite having these three dear friends
in my corner, I suspect that in the end [Johan
Östman](https://cargocollective.com/johanostman) had to sign off on me playing,
in order for it to really happen. From what I gather, he is still very much in
charge of booking. I don't think it would be possible to cold call him in order
to get a gig at the festival. Structural changes to how the booking gets dealt
with inside the organisation are traditionally floated around at the beginning
of each season, then later revised. Long story short is you need to somehow
figure out who is working _around_ Östman, and get in touch through there.
[NorbergFestival](https://norbergfestival.com/) is _the best_ and really
entirely worth playing at, always, regardless of the circumstances, so I think
folks should totally try to get a gig there, even though it might be difficult.
It's a three day festival, I played on the Saturday, in Mimer. I love that
space. It's one of my all time favourite resonant spaces. It has this amazingly
long room tone, full of complex resonances. It's a huge concrete space. Just
amazing. I split up the piece into 32 Stereo tracks that I then handed to [David
Granström](https://davidgranstrom.com/) who spatialized the piece in the 16
satellite Lacoustic speakers using his custom spatialization software
[SuperPrism](https://github.com/davidgranstrom/SuperPrism). The full Stereo mix was
sent to the house PA which was also Lacoustic but a huge line array one with
subs that I really like. A tremendous amount of air pressure is possible in the
very lowest end, which in turn creates these amazing rattling sounds in the old
defunct mine. [Mats Erlandsson](http://matserlandsson.com/) who was my producer
at the premiere was also on board to do the delicate Tonmeister work setting the
levels in the main PA. Rasmus Persson was the main sound technician and is
always so rewarding to work with. We really had an amazing team of my favourite
people working together in consort to make the sound come together both
technically as well as artistically. I really could not be happier about how
that team came together. I walked around and got the sense that the audience was
into it. A lot of folks were laying down, listening attentively. In the last
part, where the tubas come in and the overall mood changes to louder, folks came
up to me to show their excitement at the fact that their nose hairs were
tingling. Folks generally smiled, gave me thumbs up and even encouraging
shoulder pats of approval. This made me very grateful and happy to have been
given the opportunity to perform there.

<center>**Intersections of traversals at Notam**</center>

I was invited by 
<a href="https://www.madskjeldgaard.dk" target="_blank">Mads Kjeldgard</a> 
to perform at 
<a href="http://www.notam02.no/web/" target="_blank">Notam</a> 
during the season finale of their SuperCollider meetUp group. I really liked the
space. They had four Genelecs set up in Quad configuration. I made a Quad
version of the piece and projected the code. There was a nice vibe and the
audience listened attentively. I talked to a few folks afterwards and they
seemed pleased. I especially liked this one guy <a
href="https://niklasadam.oddodd.org" target="_blank">Nicklas Adam</a>'s
performance and we talked afterwards and that was great. I felt like we had a
lot in common in terms of thinking. He felt very free to me. I especially liked
how I was able to go from not feeling engaged in the beginning of the
performance to being tremendously engaged by the end of it. He changed my mind.
That always feels really invigorating for me to go through that as part of an
audience. To be transformed by a piece.

<br>

Here is the promo material and the lineup for the event:
