<br><center>**NixOS configuration**</center><br>


Let's get NixOS installed on a late 2015 eleven inch MacBook Air. It'll be fun
and easy because this walkthrough works.

First thing we need is an image of NixOS. I downlaoded the GNOME, 64-bit 
Intel/AMD graphical ISO image of the NixOS Linux distribution 
[here](https://nixos.org/download/).

Next we need something to burn the image onto a USB drive with. It is perfectly fine to 
block this program's access to the internet. It just wants to show you some ads
maybe while you are burning the image.
I decided on [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
