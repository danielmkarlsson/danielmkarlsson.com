<br><center>**Nice and easy Reaper config**</center>

I became annoyed with some things about how Reaper looked when the whole number version seven 
rolled around. It finally motivated me to put this up. I don't foresse editing this all that 
much in the future. I just want things to be nice and easy. A classic look with no clutter and 
a few handy timesavers. Nothing big just a few small things that make the work smoother.

<br><center>**Scala Scale Archive**</center>
I wanted to mess around with the Scala Scale Archive and the files were in CR-LF
format so I figured this was something I could take care of. I converted the format
and zipped em back up for ya.

<br><center>**Mimer IRs**</center>I made four impulse responses of Mimer, which
is an old defunct iron ore mine in Sweden, which now serves as
Norbergfestival's largest stage. These should be thought of as an attempt to
capture my own sense of being in that room, rather than an accurate depiction
mathematically.

<br><center>**EMS AKG**</center> I made two impulse responses of the AKG spring
reverb at EMS. I figured I could share them here. They came out pretty decent I
think. The real thing is it's own thing for sure but files win on portability
hands down so, go ahead, download 'em.

<br><center>**Current Planck EZ layout**</center> This is my current Planck EZ
layout. I have the version with leds. I have a couple of other keyboards but
this is the one I've been using most. I held out for a really long time hoping
that I would be able to get used to the stock placement of the arrow keys. That
was not happening at all a couple years in so I finally caved and changed that.
