<br><center>**Email list subscription**</center><br> 
You can sign up for an email newsletter by sending an email to:

<center>`list@danielmkarlsson.com`</center> 

with the word _subscribe_ in the subject line (any case is fine). This starts
an entirely automated process that I am unaware of. I sat this up for you
because that is what I always wanted these kinds of things to be.

If you would like to unsubscribe, then you guessed it, it's the same deal as
above, but you put the word _unsubscribe_ in the subject line. I have no way of
ever finding out if you unsubscribe because I would not like to know if that
happened.

I was going to add a fancy comma separated settings functionality in the body of
the email so that you could change the maximum frequency of emails from the
list to day, week, month, year or decade but it was way too much work. Instead
I decided to never send newsletters more frequently than once per month.

The newsletter will let you know about what is going on with me as an artist in
a very brief, headline kind of style, with links to things for in depth
reading. This will pretty much map one to one with new music and or text being
posted to my site or made available elsewhere online. Thank you for reading
this and for considering becoming a subscriber.
