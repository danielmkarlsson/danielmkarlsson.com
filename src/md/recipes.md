<br> <center> **Black Cumin Seed Crackers once a week** </center>
Put these dry ingredients together in your stainless steel baking bowl:

1/2 deciliter of fine ground flaxseeds  
2 tablespoons of chia seeds  
1 deciliter of sunflower seeds  
1 deciliter of pumpkin seeds  
1 deciliter of sesame seeds  
1/2 teaspoon of salt   
1/2 deciliter of corn flour (fine ground)  
1/2 deciliter of corn flour (coarse ground)  

Stir well.
Add 2 tablespoons of canola oil and then give it another very thorough stir.
Add 3 deciliters of boiling water and then give it another heartfelt stir.
Cover the top of the bowl with something and leave it on the counter.
Set an alarm for 40 minutes.
When the alarm goes off, set the oven to 150° celsius. 
Set an alarm for 20 minutes.
When the alarm goes off, get out a shallow oven tray.
I use two cork trivets to hold the oven tray in place on the kitchen counter.
Place a piece of baking paper on the oven tray and cut it to size.
Use a spoon to get the seed cracker dough out onto the tray.
Put it in the middle along the long side of the oven tray.
Wrap your rolling pin in cling film. 
It has to be this way, otherwise the dough will stick to the rolling pin like you would not believe.
Use the rolling pin to get the dough evenly distributed on the oven tray.
It is very important that you distribute the dough evenly and thinly without leaving any holes.
Sprinkle black cumin on the dough.
Use the rolling pin to get the black cumin adhered to the dough.
Sprinkle crunched up sea salt flakes on the dough.
Use both hands for this.
Make sure that the sea salt flakes are not too big by crunching them. 
Use the rolling pin to get the crunched up sea salt flakes adhered to the dough.
When the oven reaches 150° celsius put the oven tray in the middle of the oven, unobstructed by anything else.
Set an alarm for 42 minutes.
When the alarm goes off, get the oven tray out of the oven and onto the trivets.
Set an alarm for 40 minutes.
When the alarm goes off, get out a clean dry tin can. Put a thin layer of rice on the bottom.
Now gently crack your black cumin seed crackers to a palatable size that will fit into your can.
Store in a dry place out of the light of the sun. 
A cupboard is good for this.
I like to eat a piece or two after every meal.

<br> <center> **Cornbread once or twice a week** </center>
Fold and cut baking paper neatly into a small square oven dish. Mix up the dry 
goods in a big baking bowl.

6 deciliters of corn flour  
2.5 deciliters of grahams flour    
3.5 deciliters of wheat flour  
2 pinches of salt  
2 tablespoons of baking powder  

Heat the oven to 200° celsius. Mix up these wet ingredients separately in a 
liter sized measuring pitcher.

1 deciliter of syrup  
6 deciliters of oatdrank  
2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar  
2 deciliters of auquafaba  

Make sure everything is mixed real good before putting everything together in 
the big baking bowl. Use a stainless stell ball whisk to make sure there are 
no lumps. Pour the dough into the small square oven dish. Into the oven it goes 
for 25  minutes. Do the dishes while the bread is in the oven or else you're 
never gonna do 'em. After you get it out of the oven it's important that you 
let it cool down completely before putting it in some kind of food grade 
container because othewise the bread will get spongy from the heat and moisture
coming from the bread. Go ahead and have some hot fresh bread while you are 
waiting tho, that's fine. Put something that is nice and greasy on there, then 
maybe a lil herbal salt and or some nice hummus, maybe some thinly sliced fresh
tomato could be good.

<br> <center> **Seitanic Chörizos a couple of times a summer** </center>
Measurements for 30 Seitanic Chörizos. Start by soaking 20 grams of dried
chipotle, 5 grams of dried porcino mushrooms (Boletus edulis) in 3 deciliters
of boiling water. Put 2 table spoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 deciliter of
water into a sauté pan. Add 3 teaspoons of smoked paprika, 1 tablespoon of
sambal oelek, 3 tablespoons of miso, 9 sundried tomatoes, 3 finely minced,
large onions. Evenly distribute these ingredients with a wooden spatula. Bring
to boil at maximum heat without the lid at first. Then add the lid and turn
down the heat halfway. Keep checking in every couple of minutes to stir. Add
one whole minced garlic after some of the water has had a chance to evaporate.
Don't leave for too long on the stove, as we still want some liquid left here.
Save the water from the mushroom/chili soak in a jar for later. Get your
blender out. Add 3 teaspoons of marjoram, 3 teaspoons of thyme (Thymus
vulgaris), 3 teaspoons of gound coriander (brown powder, not green leaves),
either 6 tablespoons of tomato puré _or_ if you like your Chörizos hotter, 6
tablespoons of La Costeña Chipotles en adobo instead, 1 teaspoon of smoked
salt, 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, 200 grams of canned black beans and 3
table spoons of coconut oil (this is rock solid below 25° celcius, so plan
accordingly). Start blending, and little by little, add in some of that spicy
mushroom water from before. Proly you'll end up adding about one deciliter´s
worth. Take your time and work that blender in different modes to make this
happen. It's important to get this blend real smooth. Pour this hawt goup in a
metal bowl and set aside to let it cool for a bit. After it has cooled down some,
start kneading in 450 grams of gluten. Little by little add in some more of
that spicy mushroom water from before. Proly you want to add about 1 deciliter,
not more. Knead for about 5 minutes. Don't knead it for too long or the Chörizos
will get hard and dry. Split the dough into 50 gram pieces and roll into hot
dog shapes. You should get around 30 Seitanic Chörizos depending on how you
shape them. Roll the dogs into tinfoil. They should be tightish, but not _too_
tight as that will make them hard and dry. Steam for one hour. Add in more
boiled water every fifteen minutes. This last instruction is vital, otherwise
you will burn your pot dry. Barbecue to perfection. Serve in wholegrain hot
dog buns with all the fixens.

<br> <center> **Luxury oatmeal every morning** </center> Measurements for two
servings of every day luxury oatmeal. Start by pouring two deciliters of
steelcut oats into a small saucepan. Add two tablespoons of ground flax seeds
and one tablespoon of whole chia seeds. Pour in five deciliters of
water. Stir lightly, only once, resist the urge to stir more than once here.
Bring to boil. Stir throughly and decrease heat to medium heat for
approximately two minutes. Stir in 112.5 grams (half a box) of organic frozen
raspberries. Set heat to low and put the lid on. Leave the saucepan to do it's
thing for three to five minutes, depending on how hot you like your
raspberries. Don't leave it for _too_ long tho. We don't want to burn the oats
or for the raspberry fruit juices to get everything all soggy. Serve with cold
oatdrank, a dash of cinnemon and a finely minced organic apple.
