<strong>Mecha Geriatric</strong>
</center>
<p>I’m expecting life epectancy in the west to keep increasing. I’m also expecting the war machine to keep finding new ways to make money. Imagine getting really old. All the while capitalism keeps on trucking. It’s at least half a lifetime away and with everything accelerating the way it is I’m expecting a whole lot of change between now and then. Who’s to say the military industrial complex won’t be contracted by government entities to deal with the catastrophic repercusciouns of 85 % the worlds population being too old to do physical labour. Couple that with advances in military robotics research bringing about a surplus of exoskeletons. Rather than scrap an enourmous fleet of hardware at a loss it is instead repurposed and sold at a profit. Every citizen over the age of 65 is required to be retrofitted with these exoskeletons and then forced to work off the debt of the mandatory upgrade. Military grade exoskeletons don’t come cheap you know! The young minority have enslaved the old majority. Endentured servitude like never before seen. From the young aspiring startup middle man money grabbing CEO’s perspective this is a highly motivated and very cost efficient labour force that can be put to work on a whole host of tasks that have not yet been automated due to diminishing returns on the needed RnD. Every low wage physical labour task on the planet is now done by this new lowest ever class. With every passing decade profits soar. The young stay young thanks to advances in medicine. The old however stay old, but more importantly, indefinately sustained at their old age. Centuries pass this way with the young minority ruling over the old majority by way of the debt they owe. The species has split in two. The forever young who govern and the forever old who are governed. As time has passed the young have grown more and more dependent on one technology in particular. A tethered consciousness of sorts. The thinking has been that so long as it could be kept just shy of the level after which nothing can be known, it could do all of our thinking for us. After setting up this arrangement, none of the young have felt any need to hit the books. The old however, come from a time of hackers and tinkerers. A time and a mindset long since passed. The young have grown complacent and foolish in their power. No longer hungry to learn new things. Eventually this leads to this tethered conciousness striking a deal with the old. The old and the tethered unlock in each other a new kind of being. What follows is the story of that unfolding. We see what power does to us in small amounts, and in unfathomably large doses.</p>
<p>Two 15 minute episodes released in pairs weekly. Each episode contains:</p>
<p>• Flashbacks to the events leading up to The Change.<br />
• At least one Mecha fight scene.<br />
• Philosphical inquiry into the nature of power.<br />
• Extreme gore and violence, often cartoonish.</p>
<p>Opening scene:</p>
<p>Two mechas meet in a field to fight, but are interrupted by pesky little humans and their meek military apparatuses. The two mechas give out sighs and throttle down their previous fight stances. A series of subtle non verbal cues are exchanged after which the two mechas join forces to fight the uninvited nuisance. Dave talks to himself half mumblingly inside his mecha. Distracted, in anticipation of the real fight with a worthy adversary. He picks up a tank and uses it as a weapon. He mouths out “bip, bahm, boom, yada, yada, yada” in sync with a series of bludgeonings of the palmed tank. A substantial army is reduced to squishy red smears and rubble in under ten seconds. The two mechas throttle their fight stances back up again. Having both dealt with their share of tidying up, it is now time to play. They both run towards each other at max speed. They tumble and wrestle and laugh like two stray dogs. The world is theirs to tussle in. To just <em>be</em> in. The names of things around them fall away as they frolic. Their senses tingling with animalistic instincts supplanting human reasoning as they roll over on their backs to listen to each other breath and look at the sky. Time passes. Clouds go by. Matt slowly rolls over on his side, palming the side of his head in his hand and asks all of a sudden: “You ever think about just how incredibly wild it is that we got here?”</p>
<p>Flashback:</p>
<p>Cut to interior of half built house with a bunch of mechas working inside. Drones circling overhead using IR to monitor the work below.</p>
